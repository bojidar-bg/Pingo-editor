# Pingo-editor
An extendable, collaborative, web-based editor made using bootstrap 3.

Currently it is WIP(Work in progress), but some features are already present.
# Name
"Pingo" means "I paint" in Latin. One of the original ideas of this editor was to allow for
collaborative drawing on a whiteboard.
# TODO
* Think of a better icon (currently using a gylphicon)
* Implement layers [half-done]
* Make a nice core plugin
* Make a documentation
* Ideas?
